This HTML code creates a form where users can input their name, email, phone number, preferred date and time, service type, and any additional comments. When the user submits the form, the data is sent to a server-side script (appointment_submit.php) via AJAX for processing. The server-side script responds with a success or error message, which is displayed to the user without reloading the page.
